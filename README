SunSpec library - Provides interface to interface to SunSpec devices
====================================================================

Before building, the SMDX model directory path should be updated in include/sunspec_config.h.

The directory of model definitions in test/models/smdx can be used in place or copied to another
location in the system.

A model definition is required for any model that is desired to be supported.

Build Library
=============

> make

The library libsunspec.a is created in the /lib directory.

Run Unit Tests
==============

> make test

All tests should pass. Results are at the end of the test output.

Notes
=====

Currently the library only supports the CEA-2045 link layer interface and expects to be linked with a
module that implements the following functions:

uint16_t cea2045_flush(bool txBufClear, bool rxBufClear, bool force);
int16_t CEA2045ss_read(unsigned char *buf, uint16_t len, uint32_t timeout);
int16_t CEA2045ss_write(unsigned char *buf, uint16_t len, uint32_t timeout);
